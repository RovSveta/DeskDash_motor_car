DeskDash - Autonomous Smart Delivery Robot for Offices
The DeskDash project aims to develop an autonomous indoor delivery robot for office environments. The robot is designed to transport small packages efficiently, reducing the need for unnecessary trips and enhancing workplace productivity. Leveraging advanced robotics platforms like Lidar, ROS 2, MicroRos, Jetson Orin, camera and ESP32, DeskDash integrates room mapping, pathfinding, and obstacle avoidance technologies to navigate autonomously within an office space.

The project focuses on designing, developing, and deploying the DeskDash robot for logistical applications in office environments. The key outcome of the project includes:
1.	A fully functional DeskDash robot capable of autonomous delivery;
2.	Implementation of room mapping and pathfinding features;
3.	Implementation of line detection and object detection features;
4.	Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance.
